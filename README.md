  Utilizes advanced YOLO (You Only Look Once) computer vision algorithm for accurate and real-time fire detection.  

- **Real-time Video Streaming**  
  Provides continuous live video monitoring with seamless streaming capabilities.  

- **Automated SMS and Web Alerts**  
  Instantly sends notifications via SMS and web platforms when fire is detected.  

- **Multi-station Support**  
  Enables monitoring and management across multiple detection stations simultaneously.  

- **Vimeo Video Upload**  
  Automatically uploads detection footage to Vimeo for secure video archiving.  

- **Secure Login System**  
  Ensures authorized access with a secure authentication mechanism.
